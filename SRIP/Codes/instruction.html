		    <p class="lead">This lab allows you to design and simulate any digital combinational or sequential circuit. Following instruction help you build the state diagrams circuit. A Javascript-based basic tool and simulation enigne is at the hear of this laboratory. You can create many circuits and test them with fixed or time-varying input signals. You can also see the outputs as values or time-varying waveforms. </p>

				<p>The tool consist of mainly two pannels: Left Pannel, Right Pannel.</p>
				<ul>
				<li>
				<p><strong>Left Pannel:</strong>You can change the settings from the left pane.</p>
				<ol>
				<li>
				<p><strong>Frequency Input:</strong>The frequency input changes the frequency of the oscillator named as OSC on the simulation panel</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>If you get stuck, and are not able to make the state diagram, then load 2bit state diagram and 3bit state diagram buttons will help you out.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>Click the "Clear Workspace" button to clear the simulation.</p>
				</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p><strong>Right Pannel:</strong> The right pane contains the workspace where you will simulate your experiment.</p>
				<ol>
				<li>
				<p>The toolbox on the left contains the pre-made logic circuits you will require to build a state diagram.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>Drag them on the right, to place them on your breadboard.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>The left part of the abstracted circuit contains the inputs, and the right side the outputs.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
                <p>Click on the circle of the input or output to another input/output to make a connection.</p>
                <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
				You can connect only one line to an input, but an output can have multiple lines.
				</div>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>The "DC" icon outputs digital 1 at all times, connnect it to:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>
					<p>-push on: to simulate the 1 only when you're pressing on the button</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>-push off: to simulate 0 when you're pushing the button</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>-toggle: to toggle the output between 1 and 0.</p>
					</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
					<p>The OSC supplies 1 and 0 in a specific frequency which you set in the settings pane.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
					<p>The joint icon is just a connection, to make your connections look neater, as the lines from an output to an input are straight.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The DSO displays the output in a graph format for easy verification. It has 8 inputs, you can choose to use any number of them. If you want more, just drag drop more of them.</p>
				</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				</ul>
